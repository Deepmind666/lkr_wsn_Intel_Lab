# Augment Research Workspace

This folder contains the assistant's research-grade, reproducible additions that do not modify existing project modules. All new code, experiments, and reports created by the assistant live here, ensuring isolation and traceability.

Structure
- simulation/: Minimal, packet-level simulator and measurement tools (event/slot based)
- results/: Outputs generated by simulation runs (CSV, figures)
- configs/: YAML/JSON configs for reproducible experiments
- run_packet_sim.py: CLI entrypoint to run baseline packet-level simulations

Principles
- Reproducible: fixed seeds, YAML configs, CSV outputs
- Measurable: packet-level PDR, end-to-end delay, hop count, control overhead, energy breakdown
- Conservative claims: no exaggerated statements; results must be supported by measurements
- Non-invasive: does not change code outside augment/

Next steps
1) Use `python augment/run_packet_sim.py --help` to see options
2) Start with a small run to validate outputs
3) Expand scenarios and baselines incrementally
